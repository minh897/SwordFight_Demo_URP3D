# Sword Fight Demo
A small Unity prototype exploring how VFX, SFX, animation, and feedback transform game feel.

## Overview
This is a small solo Unity project created to study how adding VFX, SFX, animations, and feedbacks can dramatically improve the feel of a simple game. The focus is on iteration and experimentation rather than scope or content.

## Goals
- Improve game feel through visual and audio feedback
- Practice adding and tuning VFX and SFX
- Explore animation timing and responsiveness
- Compare “unpolished” vs “polished” versions

## Experiments
- Simple gameplay
- Visual effects: weapon swing, hit spark, damage flash, enemy death
- Sound effects: weapon impact, weapon swing, enemy death
- Basic animations: player attack, enemy hit
